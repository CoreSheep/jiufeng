## Hi, everyone!  

I'm **Jiufeng** (pronounced as /jo phone/) from China, you can also call me **FENG**! Welcome to my personal website. :D

I have recently completed my master's degree in Data & Computer Science at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and successfully finished my Data Scientist internship and working student position at [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/). I'm fascinated by data science, machine learning, and AI, especially the advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models. I'm also diving into the startup world with a small AI-focused team, aiming to create products that are truly valuable to people.

**AI/ML Engineer & Data Scientist** with 3+ years across academic research and production systems. Proven track record in vehicle recommender systems (Mercedes-Benz Group), NLP/RAG (Uni Heidelberg & NLP Laboratory), computer vision, and knowledge graphs — delivering low-latency inference with mixed-precision quantization and GPU-accelerated training.

Outside of tech, I'm passionate about art, music, and film. I love watching films, and I have many beloved movie directors like [Kar Wai Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Kar-wai), [Edward Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yang), [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock), [Hirokazu Kore-eda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Kore-eda), [Andrei Tarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky) and many others. Music is also close to my heart; I enjoy everything from classical to jazz, hip-hop, and rock & roll. [Frédéric Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin) and [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) are two of my all-time favorites, and their music has been a constant companion in my life.

When I'm not coding or working on projects, you'll often find me reading and doing sports — these are my favorite ways to unwind. Fitness is a big part of my life too; I've been a gym rat for almost three years now, and I also enjoy swimming, playing basketball, and hiking.

**Alongside the Banks of the Seine**  

The sky turns gray and dark,  
as waves on the Seine reflect the light from the Eiffel Tower.  

I feel the wind, so soft and tender;  
standing on the boat, I can see all of Paris—  
noisy, seductive, artistic, shining in the darkness.

**Abbesses - The Heart of[ *Amélie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie)**

Abbesses, in the vibrant Montmartre district, is central to the charm of the beloved French film *Amélie*. This metro station and its surroundings serve as the backdrop for much of Amélie Poulain’s whimsical world. 

Just steps from Abbesses, you’ll find the iconic [**Café des 2 Moulins**](https://cafedesdeuxmoulins.fr/fr), where Amélie works and weaves her quirky magic to brighten others’ lives. Montmartre’s artistic streets and village-like feel add a unique warmth, bringing to life Amélie’s dreamy Paris. The winding stairs, classic art nouveau metro entrance, and mosaic wall “I Love You” capture the romantic spirit of both the film and the neighborhood."

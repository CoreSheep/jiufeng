There are still so many goals in life—like graduating on time, finding an internship in Germany, getting a job, moving into my own place, and having a calico cat, an orange tabby, and a golden retriever. I'd like to own a home with a bedroom featuring floor-to-ceiling windows, a living room with a large balcony, and a study designed by me. A home gym and a swimming pool would be great too. Some concrete goals. And I’ll need a large wine cabinet—my tolerance has definitely gone up since moving here.

0. I appreciate the confidence I’ve built and radiate—it’s something I’ve accumulated step by step on my own, something I’ve given myself rather than received from others. So, I’m grateful to myself.

1. Confidence makes one stronger, able to independently confront difficulties and face challenges without fear. Every night, as I reflect on my day, I ask myself if I’ve become more confident. For me, confidence greatly reflects my control over life. As an ENTJ, I value order and strive to keep life under control; chaos feels like a disaster, not a surprise.

2. Maximizing time usage is key—time really flies. Sometimes, I get carried away and lose track, but that’s okay. Work hard, play hard. In this regard, Eileen Gu is a great example.

3. On my way home today, it poured. I didn’t rush back; instead, I felt a profound sense of freedom as I walked. It was as if the rain could pour all it wanted, and I wouldn’t be fazed! Perhaps we can cultivate confidence through some “physical” experiences like this!

The ocean truly has the power to heal.

One day, he said he wanted to see the sea.  
There was no particular reason; he just missed the ocean.  
He took the train overnight, enduring a long journey.  
Before dawn arrived, he finally got his wish.

He always hoped that the sea could blow away some of his worries.  
Even if it didn’t do much, he longed to stroll along the shore, feel the breeze, and play with the seagulls.

Because he understood so clearly—  
we are all children of the sea,  
nurtured, embraced, and cleansed by its vastness.

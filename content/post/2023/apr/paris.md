**Bonjour, Paris!**

My four-day, three-night solo trip in Paris has come to a perfect end. The only slight regret is not being able to visit the Louvre since I didn’t make a reservation (oh, my Mona Lisa!). Other than that, I stuck to my itinerary and checked off every spot with photos: the Eiffel Tower, the banks of the Seine, the Musée d’Orsay, the Orangerie, Versailles, Montmartre, and Sacré-Cœur.

Paris is synonymous with romance. After touring the Musée d’Orsay, I had lunch at a Chinese restaurant nearby. The owner, seeing I was Chinese, chatted with me. He told me his restaurant had been open in Paris for seven years and that he loved it here. “Everyone has their own unique style,” he said. “People are confident and free.”

I couldn’t agree more. Somebody says that in Paris, as long as you have a job, you can live romantically, freely, and effortlessly. My first impression of Paris was indeed like that—unrestrained and deeply romantic.

Over these few days, I developed a certain fondness for the Paris Metro. At first, it felt a bit run-down and even dirty. But gradually, I came to like it, taking it over ten times. The trains are green, without graffiti or ads, and quite clean. The only odd thing is you have to open the doors manually, and you have no button to press. I hadn’t realized this at first until a guy kindly showed me—awkward but funny! Almost made the people behind miss their stop.

Each carriage holds people of every background and color—white, yellow, black—much like New York. This diversity is another reason Paris is so alluring; it’s welcoming and gives a sense of unrestrained freedom. You feel relaxed, confident, and at ease.

Paris is perhaps the most culturally and artistically vibrant city in Europe—a true paradise for art lovers. Museums of every type are here: the Louvre, the Orsay, the Orangerie, the Pompidou Center, and more. Immersing yourself in art here brings lightness and even a hint of elegance. Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir—all the Impressionist masters make Paris as romantic as it is.

This solo trip was such a joy. I found there’s something indescribably wonderful about traveling alone—like a brave backpacker or a curious explorer. You can wander as you please, plan every detail yourself, and just dive into the experience.

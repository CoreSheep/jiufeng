Compared to other big cities like Berlin or Hamburg, Heidelberg might feel like a small village, but there’s no denying its beauty. It’s a beauty steeped in cultural heritage and rich history. It reminds me of the Altay in [Li Juan](https://bcaf.org.cn/Li-Juan-A-Writer-s-Journey-to-the-Altay-Northern-Xinjiang)’s writing—although there are no pastures or grasslands here, I can still find my own little piece of tranquility.

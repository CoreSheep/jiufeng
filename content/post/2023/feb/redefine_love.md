Recently, I went through a few things that gave me a new perspective on love. After studying for my finals all morning and afternoon, I decided to jot down some of these thoughts.

### I. How Do You Know If the Person You're With Is Truly the One You Love?

1. **A Deep Connection**  
   True love goes beyond surface attraction; it involves a profound connection, both physical and emotional. This connection is a natural pull towards each other, an inner attraction that feels like mutual support. When you’re truly in love, you experience this link intensely, enjoying each other’s company, sharing thoughts and feelings without reservation, and engaging in deep conversations.

2. **Mutual Support and Dependence**  
   Love, abstract yet tangible, requires you to assess whether your relationship promotes growth and resilience. Real love is when you’re willing to pause even the most important things for the other person, becoming their anchor during challenging times. When you genuinely love someone, you become each other’s support, always there when needed.

3. **Shared Values**  
   Similar values ease harmony and understanding, often translating into shared goals. When values align, your relationship feels meaningful, solid, and healthy, as you work towards common objectives.

4. **Trust**  
   Trust is the bedrock of love. I didn’t fully grasp its importance until life experiences taught me that those who truly matter in our lives are often the ones we trust the most. Trust signifies deep love and the sense of safety it brings—knowing that they’ll be by your side no matter what.

5. **Physical Closeness**  
   Long-distance relationships are challenging, as love is fragile, words can fall short, but being present offers warmth and comfort. Distance often breeds insecurity and distrust, requiring immense effort to maintain. To love truly is to want to be together, even if only for a day, a year—choosing to stay by each other’s side whenever possible.

### II. How to Know If the New Person in Your Life Is Truly the One

Assessing whether someone new is worth loving isn’t easy. Love is a powerful word, one not to be used lightly, as a wise friend once reminded me. Love is complex, and rarely are life’s lessons simple. Even if they don’t walk through life with you forever, the experience brings invaluable growth and understanding of love itself.

### III. How to Heal After Love

1. **Allow Yourself to Feel Sad**  
   Heartbreak isn’t the end; if you’re sad, embrace it fully. Cry by the river, in the shower, or even in front of a friend. Be honest with your emotions rather than repress them. Sadness needs release as a first step toward healing.

2. **Keep Yourself Busy**  
   Life’s river flows on with responsibilities—studies, exams, work, future plans. We don’t have endless time to dwell on sorrow. Move forward, for perhaps they just weren’t the right fit, and someone who understands and complements you better may come along.

3. **Stay Connected with Friends and Family**  
   Friends and family are your safe harbor. Reach out to them, spend time with them, and lean on their support to move forward.

4. **Write Down Your Feelings**  
   Writing is an effective way to face heartbreak. Reflect on what you learned, how you grew, and what aspects could improve. When you calmly analyze a past relationship, you gain valuable insights—this is honesty in action.

And that’s where I’ll end for today. I feel brighter and more resilient with each passing day. Instead of complaining, I ask myself, *What did this experience teach me?* Truly, “Life teaches us far more than books ever could.” Kindness is essential—to those around us and to the world itself. When we approach life gently, life, in turn, treats us with kindness.

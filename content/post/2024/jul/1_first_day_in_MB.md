I’m part of a Data & AI team within Marketing & Sales, focusing primarily on personalized recommendation systems based on user data and applications of Generative AI. After nearly a month, I’ve familiarized myself with the team’s core operations—how we gather user data, perform data cleaning, and use Databricks for in-depth data cleansing and classification. I’ve also learned how to set up API endpoints, manage in-memory operations with Redis, and leverage MLflow for streamlined MLOps and DevOps, including CI/CD. Of course, this also includes optimizing models and refining feature selection.

Overall, German corporations, particularly in the automotive industry, offer excellent infrastructure support for AI. However, there’s a noticeable gap in creativity and openness, especially with the additional restrictions imposed by the European AI Act and internal AI privacy and security regulations. These limitations make it challenging to launch and even advance Generative AI products.

Another observation is that the pace in large companies tends to be quite slow—sometimes overly so, in my view. Big corporations may not be ideal for those with greater ambition, as you often need to synchronize with multiple small teams. For instance, our team often completes tasks faster than others, so we end up waiting for MBTI or even other third-party teams to finish their parts before we can proceed.

On the plus side, an internship in a big company offers valuable insights into architecture and management practices, such as efficiently setting up sprints, conducting reviews, and establishing interim PI OKRs. I’m applying these lessons to my own AI startup team as well.

A good friend of mine always says that no matter where you are, as long as you do your best and excel in your work, you’ll learn a lot. But deep down, I find myself yearning for a more creative and ambitious team. Wishing everyone success in their career journeys!

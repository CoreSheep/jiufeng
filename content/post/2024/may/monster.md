I watched [Hirokazu Kore-eda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Kore-eda)’s [*Monster*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(2023_film)) tonight, and I started to feel that there must be a kind, innocent boy in Kore-eda’s heart—otherwise, he couldn’t create such delicate stories. Now I’m itching to travel to Japan, to see Mount Fuji and cherry blossoms, and ride the Shinkansen.

Recently, my life has slowed down a bit. It’s no longer as hectic and overwhelming as when I first arrived in Germany; everything’s finally falling into place, and it feels great to have a steady grip on things. I’m starting to feel that relaxed pace of European life, with more time for myself to read, work out, watch movies, go for walks, and take photos.

This is my song  
And no one can take it away  
It's been so long  
But now you're here  
Here to stay    

And I wonder  
If you know what it means  
To find your dreams come true    

This is my song  
And no one can make it a lie  
It's been so long  
Since someone  
Could make me cry  
  
And I wonder  
If you know what it means  
To laugh as tears go by  
  
I may not always sing in tune  
And sometimes you don't hear me  
But you don't have to be near me  
To know that I'm singing  
 
This is my song  
And nothing  
Can make it die  
It's been so long  
And it's stronger  
I know why  
 
And I wonder  
If you really  
Really know  

That as long  
As I live  
I will sing my song for you

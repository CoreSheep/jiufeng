1. Spent the whole morning replying to a couple of emails, listening to some favorite music, and tidying up. Pretty chill, haha.

2. Been making progress at the gym lately and shaping my body in a good way, and I’m eating pretty healthy too. I’m trying to come up with more recipes that balance fitness, health, and taste. Next week, I’ll try to make some new chinese food. Even though I’m a bit tired after work recently, cooking every day still makes me feels like more comfortable and calm.

3. Everyone deserves a room of their own—a space where both body and soul feel peaceful and creative. Here, you can read, watch favorite movies, enjoy some funny shows, snack on spicy chips or sunflower seeds. It’s also a place to reflect, self-build, and have real conversations with yourself. It’s about understanding, motivating, and being grateful to yourself, and try to grow into a better version of who you are.

Just some thoughts, haha.  
Peace & Love.

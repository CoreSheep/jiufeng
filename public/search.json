After nearly a month, I’ve familiarized myself with the team’s core operations—how we gather user data, perform data cleaning, and use Databricks for in-depth data cleansing and classification. I’ve also learned how to set up API endpoints, manage in-memory operations with Redis, and leverage MLflow for streamlined MLOps and DevOps, including CI/CD. Of course, this also includes optimizing models and refining feature selection.\nOverall, German corporations, particularly in the automotive industry, offer excellent infrastructure support for AI. However, there’s a noticeable gap in creativity and openness, especially with the additional restrictions imposed by the European AI Act and internal AI privacy and security regulations. These limitations make it challenging to launch and even advance Generative AI products.\nAnother observation is that the pace in large companies tends to be quite slow—sometimes overly so, in my view. Big corporations may not be ideal for those with greater ambition, as you often need to synchronize with multiple small teams. For instance, our team often completes tasks faster than others, so we end up waiting for MBTI or even other third-party teams to finish their parts before we can proceed.\nOn the plus side, an internship in a big company offers valuable insights into architecture and management practices, such as efficiently setting up sprints, conducting reviews, and establishing interim PI OKRs. I’m applying these lessons to my own AI startup team as well.\nA good friend of mine always says that no matter where you are, as long as you do your best and excel in your work, you’ll learn a lot.

The story revolves around a mother, played by Sakura Andō, who confronts her son’s teacher after noticing disturbing changes in her child’s behavior. It’s Kore-eda’s first film directed from someone else’s script since Maborosi (1995). The film also features the final score by the late Ryuichi Sakamoto, to whom it’s dedicated.\nThe movie premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, competing for the Palme d’Or and winning the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay awards. Released in Japan on June 2, 2023, Monster received widespread acclaim for its storytelling, direction, performances, and score, making it onto many top-ten lists of the year’s best films.\n","description":"I watched Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Monster tonight, and I started to feel that there must be a kind, innocent boy in Kore-eda’s heart—otherwise ...","tags":["movie","japanesemovie","hirokazukore-eda"],"title":"Monster","uri":"/post/2024/may/monster/"},{"content":"Goodbye Chandler, goodbye my FRIENDS.\n","tags":["goodbyechandler"],"title":"Goodbye Chandler","uri":"/notes/2023/oct/note10/"},{"content":"The vibe between friends is so important.

The only slight regret is not being able to visit the Louvre since I didn’t make a reservation (oh, my Mona Lisa!). Other than that, I stuck to my itinerary and checked off every spot with photos: the Eiffel Tower, the banks of the Seine, the Musée d’Orsay, the Orangerie, Versailles, Montmartre, and Sacré-Cœur.\nParis is synonymous with romance. After touring the Musée d’Orsay, I had lunch at a Chinese restaurant nearby. The owner, seeing I was Chinese, chatted with me. He told me his restaurant had been open in Paris for seven years and that he loved it here. “Everyone has their own unique style,” he said. “People are confident and free.”\nI couldn’t agree more. Somebody says that in Paris, as long as you have a job, you can live romantically, freely, and effortlessly. My first impression of Paris was indeed like that—unrestrained and deeply romantic.\nOver these few days, I developed a certain fondness for the Paris Metro. At first, it felt a bit run-down and even dirty. But gradually, I came to like it, taking it over ten times. The trains are green, without graffiti or ads, and quite clean. The only odd thing is you have to open the doors manually, and you have no button to press. I hadn’t realized this at first until a guy kindly showed me—awkward but funny! Almost made the people behind miss their stop.\nEach carriage holds people of every background and color—white, yellow, black—much like New York. This diversity is another reason Paris is so alluring; it’s welcoming and gives a sense of unrestrained freedom. You feel relaxed, confident, and at ease.\nParis is perhaps the most culturally and artistically vibrant city in Europe—a true paradise for art lovers. Museums of every type are here: the Louvre, the Orsay, the Orangerie, the Pompidou Center, and more. Immersing yourself in art here brings lightness and even a hint of elegance. Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir—all the Impressionist masters make Paris as romantic as it is.\nThis solo trip was such a joy. I found there’s something indescribably wonderful about traveling alone—like a brave backpacker or a curious explorer. You can wander as you please, plan every detail yourself, and just dive into the experience.\n","description":"My four-day, three-night solo trip in Paris has come to a perfect end.

After studying for my finals all morning and afternoon, I decided to jot down some of these thoughts.\nI. How Do You Know If the Person You’re With Is Truly the One You Love? A Deep Connection\nTrue love goes beyond surface attraction; it involves a profound connection, both physical and emotional. This connection is a natural pull towards each other, an inner attraction that feels like mutual support. When you’re truly in love, you experience this link intensely, enjoying each other’s company, sharing thoughts and feelings without reservation, and engaging in deep conversations.\nMutual Support and Dependence\nLove, abstract yet tangible, requires you to assess whether your relationship promotes growth and resilience. Real love is when you’re willing to pause even the most important things for the other person, becoming their anchor during challenging times. When you genuinely love someone, you become each other’s support, always there when needed.\nShared Values\nSimilar values ease harmony and understanding, often translating into shared goals. When values align, your relationship feels meaningful, solid, and healthy, as you work towards common objectives.\nTrust\nTrust is the bedrock of love. I didn’t fully grasp its importance until life experiences taught me that those who truly matter in our lives are often the ones we trust the most. Trust signifies deep love and the sense of safety it brings—knowing that they’ll be by your side no matter what.\nPhysical Closeness\nLong-distance relationships are challenging, as love is fragile, words can fall short, but being present offers warmth and comfort. Distance often breeds insecurity and distrust, requiring immense effort to maintain. To love truly is to want to be together, even if only for a day, a year—choosing to stay by each other’s side whenever possible.\nII. How to Know If the New Person in Your Life Is Truly the One Assessing whether someone new is worth loving isn’t easy. Love is a powerful word, one not to be used lightly, as a wise friend once reminded me. Love is complex, and rarely are life’s lessons simple. Even if they don’t walk through life with you forever, the experience brings invaluable growth and understanding of love itself.\nIII. How to Heal After Love Allow Yourself to Feel Sad\nHeartbreak isn’t the end; if you’re sad, embrace it fully. Cry by the river, in the shower, or even in front of a friend. Be honest with your emotions rather than repress them. Sadness needs release as a first step toward healing.\nKeep Yourself Busy\nLife’s river flows on with responsibilities—studies, exams, work, future plans. We don’t have endless time to dwell on sorrow. Move forward, for perhaps they just weren’t the right fit, and someone who understands and complements you better may come along.\nStay Connected with Friends and Family\nFriends and family are your safe harbor. Reach out to them, spend time with them, and lean on their support to move forward.\nWrite Down Your Feelings\nWriting is an effective way to face heartbreak. Reflect on what you learned, how you grew, and what aspects could improve. When you calmly analyze a past relationship, you gain valuable insights—this is honesty in action.\nAnd that’s where I’ll end for today. I feel brighter and more resilient with each passing day. Instead of complaining, I ask myself, What did this experience teach me? Truly, “Life teaches us far more than books ever could.” Kindness is essential—to those around us and to the world itself. When we approach life gently, life, in turn, treats us with kindness.\n","description":"Recently, I went through a few things that gave me a new perspective on love. After studying for my finals all morning and afternoon ...","tags":["love","relationships","companionship"],"title":"The Right to Redefine Love","uri":"/post/2023/feb/redefine_love/"},{"content":"When it comes to reading, giving advice feels almost unnecessary; true lovers of reading will naturally develop their own methods and preferences. One book often leads us to another, effortlessly drawing us into new ideas and stories. I imagine many of you have had a similar experience. But here, I’d like to share a few thoughts on how young people in their twenties might approach reading.\nFirst, this stage of life is one of the most precious. It’s a time to shape, develop, and refine our values, our outlook on life, and our understanding of the world. It’s also a period of preparation, where we lay the foundation for our future careers. The importance of this time can’t be overstated. Precisely because it is so precious, we need to make the most of it as a preparatory period, these vital ten years of our lives, to make substantial progress toward personal growth.\nFrankly, I don’t believe in promoting anxieties about appearance, body image, age, career, or financial independence. From books on psychology, biology, and physics, I’ve come to understand that anxiety is innate, a form of natural chaos, and it’s something we all experience every day. Many choose to overcome it, but my advice is to live with it—much like coexisting with a virus. In biology, symbiosis is a fundamental part of stable ecosystems. This wise, almost philosophical approach should be applied to our daily lives.\nWith that said, let’s talk about how to make these years a time of powerful self-preparation. Start by asking yourself: what kind of person do I want to be in ten years? What kind of work do I want to do? What goals do I want to achieve? Some people say these questions are difficult to answer right away; they prefer to take life as it comes, dealing with each step as it unfolds. There’s nothing wrong with that. Focusing on the present and cherishing the moment is a valuable mindset.\nBut why, then, do I insist on the importance of long-term planning? If you look at the lives of people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Peter Lynch, you’ll see how critical a long-term plan can be. A roadmap for life is like a compass that guides us forward, helping us make wise and well-aligned choices. With a long-term plan, our decisions become more purposeful, more prioritized; we learn to weigh options, understand opportunity costs, and maximize resources to stay on a steady course toward a set direction.\nLet’s briefly talk about what kind of books to read. In Huai Gai Ji (华盖集）, Lu Xun recommends that young people read more foreign books and fewer or no Chinese books. Admittedly, this advice may not hold entirely true today, and there are historical, social, and national reasons for it. But at its heart, Lu Xun’s intent was to encourage us to read books that stimulate thought, inspire imagination, and provoke deep reflection—not works that are outdated, shallow, or rigid in thinking. In this sense, we can understand his deeper meaning.\nBooks can broadly be divided into fiction and nonfiction. Fiction—literature, novels, drama—is mostly “inward-facing,” enriching our emotional perception and inner lives. Reading literature and novels softens and strengthens us, honing our sensitivity and depth. Fiction brings a nuanced, vibrant, and profound awareness.\nUntil age 22, fiction was my passion. I read Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Hölderlin, William Shakespeare, Paul Celan, Jorge Luis Borges, Stanisław Lem, Susan Sontag, Raymond Carver, Ian McEwan, James Joyce], Roberto Bolaño, Yu Hua, Anton Chekhov, Julio Cortázar, Aristotle, Plato, Philippe Jaccottet, Lu Xun, Wisława Szymborska, Mikhail Lermontov,Italo Calvino, and many others. These great minds were a source of solace in the quiet hours of the night.\nYet, I found that this wasn’t enough. Reading literature and novels made my inner life richer and deeper, but it hadn’t significantly strengthened my ability to think critically. I needed a broader, more rational, and more scientific understanding of society, the nation, the world, and even the universe—a perspective that wasn’t limited to emotional perception. So I began to read more social sciences, natural sciences, history, economics, physics, mathematics, and law. My appetite grew, and I realized I was willing to read anything valuable.\nBeyond fiction lies nonfiction, covering fields like natural sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, computer science), social sciences (economics, political science, psychology, law, history, philosophy), mathematics (which is not a science), and more. After age 22, I consciously devoted more time to nonfiction, and that shift became the core of my reading philosophy today.\nI began reading extensively in economics, covering topics like macroeconomics, microeconomics, marketing, value investing, economic cycles, international trade, consumer behavior, and corporate management. This gave me a new lens to understand society, social structures, companies, consumption, and investment. Later, I dove into physics and mathematics, including Newton’s The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Euclid’s Elements (Euclid is my most admired Greek philosopher, even more than Aristotle and Plato), Einstein’s Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, and Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time, which completely reshaped my understanding of time and space.\nI then explored European history, Western history, world history, and the entire history of humankind—from ancient times to the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution to modern civilization, from the First World War to the Second, from the rise of the Third Reich to the fall of the Nazi regime, from the American Revolution to the division of East and West Germany during the Cold War. During this period, I also read about psychology, time management, personal growth, political philosophy, and entrepreneurship. This breadth of reading has made me both more confident and more humble. The more I read, the more I recognized my own ignorance. Curiosity and the thirst for knowledge continue to drive me, pushing me to read more, think more, learn more, and grow in depth, insight, and breadth.\nFinally, here’s my humble suggestion: as young adults in our twenties, we should focus more on nonfiction than fiction. This relates to prioritization, as highlighted in psychology and self-management. Precisely because these years are so valuable, we should choose books that foster meaningful growth. From an economic standpoint, we should consider opportunity cost, focusing on actions with greater long-term value. Among nonfiction, I recommend reading extensively in economics, natural sciences, history, biographies, and law.\nFiction often explores what it means to be human—how people think, make decisions, experience emotions, and the essence of being human. Nonfiction, however, steps beyond the human dimension to explore the structure and workings of society, our role within it, and our place in the universe. While fiction does touch on these subjects, it often provides more subjective answers, whereas nonfiction offers a more structured, rational analysis. In this regard, nonfiction tends to be deeper. Some may argue that we should first understand ourselves before seeking to understand the world, as the Oracle of Delphi advises. Yet without a clear and comprehensive grasp of the world and society around us, we cannot truly know ourselves.\nOf course, this is only my personal perspective, based on my own reading journey and rational reflection, so it may carry personal biases and flaws. But I hope it may resonate with some. If advice has the potential to help someone grow, even in a small way, then it’s good advice.\nTo reiterate my suggestion: focus on nonfiction. Read more in economics, history, science, biography, and law.\n","description":"When it comes to reading, giving advice feels almost unnecessary; ...","tags":["reading","books"],"title":"On Reading: Advice for Young People in Their Twenties","uri":"/post/2022/may/on_reading/"}]
